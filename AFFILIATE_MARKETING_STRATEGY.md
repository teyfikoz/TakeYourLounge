## Tracking & Optimization

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Click-through Rate (CTR)** - What % of visitors click affiliate links?
   - Target: 3-5% on high-intent pages
2. **Conversion Rate** - What % of clicks convert to sales?
   - Target: 2-5% (varies by program)
3. **Earnings Per Click (EPC)** - Average revenue per affiliate click
   - Target: $0.50-$2.00 (higher for credit cards)
4. **Revenue Per 1000 Visitors (RPM)** - Affiliate revenue per 1000 pageviews
   - Target: $15-$50

### A/B Testing Priorities
1. **CTA button text:**
   - "Get Priority Pass" vs "Join Priority Pass" vs "Book Now"
2. **CTA placement:**
   - Top of page vs inline vs sticky footer
3. **CTA design:**
   - Button color (brand vs high-contrast)
   - Size and prominence
4. **Landing page variations:**
   - Long-form vs short-form content
   - Video vs text-based explanations

### Monthly Reporting

- Seasonal trends (Q4 holiday travel spike expected)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **Affiliate program rejection** → Apply to multiple programs, build track record with smaller programs first
2. **Low conversion rates** → A/B test CTAs, improve content quality, target higher-intent keywords
3. **Cookie blocking (iOS, browser privacy features)** → Implement server-side tracking where possible
4. **Compliance violations** → Review FTC guidelines regularly, use disclosure templates
5. **Program termination** → Diversify across multiple programs, never rely on single affiliate source

### Backup Strategy
- If denied by major programs (Priority Pass, Amex), focus on:
  - Day pass bookings (easier approval)
  - Smaller credit card issuers
  - Direct partnerships with individual lounges
  - Sponsored content opportunities
